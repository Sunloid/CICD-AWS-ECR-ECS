# CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Nexus, and AWS
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Nexus and AWS. The pipeline is designed to automate the build, test and deployment processes for projects, ensuring streamline workflows and consistent high-quality code releases 

## Overview 
This CI/CD pipeline configuration leverages popular DevOps tools to automate the complete software delivery lifecycle. Jenkins as the orchestrator, managing the flow through each stage of the pipeline. The setup includes continuous integration with Maven for build management, SonarQube for static code analysis, Nexus for artifact repository management and AWS for scalabled deployment. 

## Pipeline Workflow 
1. **Build**: Jenkins initiates the build process, using Maven to compile the code to handle project dependencies. 
2. **Code Quality Analysis**: SonarQube assesses the code for quality, security, and maintainability standards.
3. **Artifact Management**: Nexus securely stores versioned artifacts, ensuring they are readily available for deployments.
4. **Deployment**: Jenkins deploys artifacts to AWS, utilizing ECS to run applications in a scalable, managed environment.

## Prerequisites 
To successfully set up and run this pipeline, you will need the following:

1. **AWS CLI**: Configured on the Jenkins instance for integration with AWS services.
2. **Docker**: Required for Jenkins container builds and deployments.
3. **Jenkins**: Orchestrates the pipeline.
4. **SonarQube**: Code Quality analysis.
5. **Nexus**: Artifact storage management.
6. **AWS ECS**: Used to deploy the and run the applications in a scalable, managed environment. 
7. **AWS ECR**: Used for the storage of images of the application made by the docker.
